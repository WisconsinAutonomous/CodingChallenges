## PID Coding Challenge
This is the first of two options for this year's controls coding challenge. It goes over the basics of PID (Proportional – Integral – Derivative) control and includes a short coding challenge to write your
own PID controller. PID controllers are one of the most common types of control systems, and are used in a variety of industries and applications – including our 
own car!

## Running the Challenge
Before you begin, we recommend that you are familiar with basic coding (conditionals, loops, functions, classes). 
The PID challenge is run using Jupyter notebooks. You can access & run it either locally on your computer (provided you have python and jupyter installed), or on Google Colab. You shouldn't need Google Colab for this assignment, and it may be easier to open it locally instead of trying to load the repository in Colab, but you can do so if you prefer.

This challenge is not designed to be _easy_, but it is designed to be solvable in a couple hours of focused work. You 
may find that you have to do some additional research to come up with an approach to the problem or even just to get 
started, and that's expected. We often have to do research into state of the art methods
to develop our own algorithms, as the autonomous vehicle space is constantly changing and on 
the bleeding edge. Don't overthink it, though – we don't expect a perfect solution! 

## Tips
1. Start by reading through the challenge description and background in `PIDChallenge.ipynb`. 
2. You are allowed to use any resources available to you. Google is your friend!
3. Document as much as you can. We are looking for team members who are good communicators :)

# Wisconsin Autonomous Perception Coding Challenge

This coding challenge is designed for us to evaluate what you can bring to the table and an opportunity for you to get some hands on experience with the tools we use in the team. Our perception software uses OpenCV for much of our image processing. A good understanding of image processing techniques and OpenCV is important for our success. This challenge aims to evaluate your problem-solving approach to computer vision problems. 


## Challenge Description
You are tasked to create a perception algorithm that can detect the boundaries of a straight path defined by cones taken by a camera attached to a vehicle, like the image below. Your code should draw boundary lines of the path on the image and save it as a png, "answer.png".

## Submission Specification
- Your code should be written in either Matlab, Python, or C++.
- Please upload your code to a public github repository for us to review
- Please document your code. The more readable your code is the better you can show your coding skills.
- Please include a README that contains the following:
    - answer.png
    - Methodolgy 
    - What did you try and why do you think it did not work.
    - What libraries are used

## Tips
1. You are allowed to use any resources available to you. Google is your friend!
3. Document as much as you can. We are looking for team members who are good communicators :)
4. The learning curve can be steep here! We don't want you to get stuck! Feel free to message in slack if you have questions.
